## Description

This web site is an attempt to re-create the Pizza.Net web site that Sandra Bullock orders pizza from during the opening credits of the 1995 film _The Net_. The page, with custom ghastly styling, will take the user's personal information, then let them place a pizza order, and finally calculates the cost of the order.

## Specifications

* User can enter their name, address and phone number for the purposes of making a (simulated) pizza delivery. The site will take the user's name and print it in the sign-off greeting below.

* User can add as many pizzas as they wish to their order, one at a time. Each pizza has three choices for size, three choices for crust style, and can have up to 8 toppings, all of which affects the final cost of that pizza.

* As each pizza is added to the order, the information for that pizza is then added to an order summary panel below, listing size, crust, toppings, and price.

* Finally, when the user submits their final order, the order form is hidden on the page and a sign-off is revealed, showing the user's name, the total cost of their order, and some _very_ sharp looking pizza clip art.
